# GMTK-2023

## What this is?
was supposed to be a game for a game jam, but since I was tired at the time at the uni I was not able to do as much as I wanted, 
whoever I left the code OS in case any dev wish to use it as a left-right movement, since I believe it already has an acceleration curve in it.

## Do you need to give me credits?
NOP, but I'd appreciate it if you did.

## Can I expand on it?
YES, expand on the idea and go nuts.
I'd like it to be a platformer like Celeste or Mario, so people could have a code to learn from.
but your shot at the end of the day.
